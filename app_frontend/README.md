Base for React Components

## Reason

Developing and publishing multiple React components requires a lot of work to keep them all at the same code, ops, best-practices level. Most of configs are often copy-pasted. If one project updated, for example, .eslintrc, other projects should follow to keep codebase consistent. Having growing number of components leads to a more diverged codebase that is exponentially harder to manage.
